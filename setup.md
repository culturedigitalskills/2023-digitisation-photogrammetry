<!--
FIXME: Setup instructions live in this document. Please specify the tools and
the data sets the Learner needs to have installed.
-->


## Equipment


For this lesson you will need to following equipment:

- **Digital camera**: a compact or a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera can be used. Preferably you should use a camera that allows manual control. **The  minimum** resolution requirement is a 5 MP camera, but it is recommended to choose a camera with better resolution (e.g. 12 MP camera for professional quality).
- **Lens**: Fixed lenses are preferred but if 
you have a variable lens, do not use the zoom and 
define one fixed focal length <!--(to its maximum or 
minimal value right from the start)-->. 
A focal length of 50mm (as roughly our eyes) or 
higher would generally work well (generally it is preferable not to go below 35mm). For small objects a 
lens between 60mm and 80mm would be 
optimal<!-- or a macro lens could be used too-->.
-	**Tripod** can be used if using a 
turntable for stable camera placement or for shooting when light conditions do not permit to maintain an aperture speed above 1/60 of a second when holding it by hand. 
- **Remote control** for camera when object need to be rotated manually or the camera is placed away form the photographer.
- **Turntable** manual or automatic (which can be syncronized with the time of the camera shooting).
- **Diffused artificial light** to eliminate shadows as much as possible.
- **Circular polarizing filter** for reflective artefacts.
- **Laptop or PC** with at least 16GB RAM.

## Software Setup

For this tutorial you will need access to:
<!--
- **Image processing software**: such as [GIMP](),
or [Adobe Photoshop](). This will allow you to
manipulate and post-process photographic images
used during the process.
- **Photogrammetry software**: there are various 
options, and the steps
described will change depending on the software used.
-->

- **Image processing software**: such as [Raw Therapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/) for batch converting raw images from camera to use in photogrammetry software, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) which allows to
manipulate and post-process textures generated during the process. 
- **Photogrammetry software**: there are various options, and the steps described will vary depending on the software used. [Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) - commercial, [Meshroom](https://alicevision.org) - open source.


**For this specific tutorial** we will use [3DF ZEPHYR](https://www.3dflow.net) - free basic version.

## Examples Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
For this lesson there are different types of data sets that you can choose for building different 3d models, ranging from a small object to an entire building.
Firstly try to experiment with a [small wooden case](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_RkNCMkpSdzg1ckNkbUJ0eUV0ZTVsNmM5SzlIOUF0dkVKQXZHVC80cVg0RlEvVzVxcXhVWEY1MUpHQnEyaWlFTA==) and then continue [with a small wooden horse](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_cUd5dVh5d0VDUEg5enNSZXF4RFY4R1hBaG4yaXRaMGdMbE1adU5XZFRHYW1DMWZoWVdvVitIVy9EVDduYjJ3Qg==). These two type of models are almost of the same size however they differentiate in their topology and you will need to use different approches to get to the final result.For the horse you would need also a [second part](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_RjFkYTBvTUFiZnpLNnAreFhvSWJpWTVORm51ZGJrTXpKWkNkZWVQZkF6QXRQY1I3dnA4elpWdzY1cU1qVUxnMQ==) because shape you will learn how to merge different chunks of the same model.

Later you can also experiment with a larger model of a [small sculpture](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_Y2xqazRYR3BBOE5DODVXNksxd2Q5ZnJvZElDTDR5TjZqdC9ETnUydjJoeEVQT0o2NkRrajhZenNsVmhtVUFXNA==) which reside in Brighton (UK) and even with a [larger one of Queen Victoria](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_S1Z0U2srVkVqRHI5RVBETFZsVVhFcTh0U2xvc1p2MUM1T1d0d2Y4Y2VXNzZTVytsQnRDTjlxWXJMNm1FVkpEWQ==) also situated in the center Brighton (UK)

### Details

For this lesson, you will need access to some paper and pen. 

Access to the [Culture Digital Skills Virtual Research Environment D4Science](https://services.d4science.org/group/culturedigitalskills) is also 
required.

If you have not registered, it would be useful to do this before
the lesson. For more information, see [instructions](https://universityofbrighton.github.io/2023-fair-multidimensional-media/virtual-research-environment.html#virtual-research-environments-vre)
