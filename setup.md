FIXME: Setup instructions live in this document. Please specify the tools and
the data sets the Learner needs to have installed.

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop

## Software Setup

For this tutorial you will need access to:

- **Image processing software**: such as [GIMP](),
or [Adobe Photoshop](). This will allow you to
manipulate and post-process photographic images
used during the process.
- **Photogrammetry software**: there are various 
options, and the steps
described will change depending on the software used.



## Equipment


For this lesson you will need to following equipment:

- **Digital camera**: a compact or a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera can be used. Preferably you should use a camera that allows manual control.
-	**Resolution**: minimum resolution requirements 
are for a 5 MP camera. For better quality choose 
a camera with better resolution (e.g. 12 MP camera for professional quality).
- **Lens**: Fixed lenses are preferred but if 
you have a variable lens, try not to zoom and 
define one focal length (to its maximum or 
minimal value right from the start). 
A focal length of 50mm (as the eyes see it) or 
higher would generally work well (generally it is preferable not to go below 35mm). For small objects a 
lens between 60mm and 80mm would be an 
option or a macro lens could be used too.
-	**Tripod** can be used if using a 
turntable for stable camera placement, 
- **Remote control** for camera.
- **Turntable**.
- **Diffused artificial light**.
- **Circular polarising filter** (for reflective artefacts).

You will also need access to a laptop or a 
PC with at least 16GB RAM.
