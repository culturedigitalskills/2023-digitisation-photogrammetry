## Capturing Photographs

Start the acquisition from an angle/view of 
the object that has many details and is not very plain.


### Overlapping
You need enough image overlap, around 50-60%, to 
make sure that the software will be able to 
align the images correctly. 

Remember that 
you should avoid having *blind-zones* and the 
object should occupy the maximum possible frame area. 

Close-up photos are allowed only to capture minor details.

### Number of images
20-60 for each 360 acquisition. 
Remember that it is better to have more images 
than less. 
*Bad* images (e.g. blurred, not in focus) can be 
deleted before processing.

### Texture
Plain and monotonous surfaces should be avoided. 

Flat, shiny, transparent, very thin artefacts 
and textures such as fur, hair won’t be the 
ideal candidates for photogrammetry. 

Crossing objects (e.g. leaves of a tree) and 
moving objects are not good candidates either. 
Significant colour changes or colour designs 
on a relatively plain surface could provide 
good reference points and help us to 
produce a model. 
The best candidates are solid, matte, textured artefacts.

### Reflections
Some objects are shinny and the 
reflections will result in having lots 
of noise, hence a ‘bad’ model. 

Adding talc or corn-starch on the 
surface of the object could be a solution 
but this cannot be applied on most 
cultural heritage artefacts.

### Targets/markers
You can put markers and targets 
on/around/underneath the object 
that you want to acquire to help the 
software with the aligning process. 

To support accurate measurements of 3D 
data you can also place a calibrated scale 
image underneath the object (or scale bars around it). 

Remember that these points should remain in 
the same position with respect to the object. 
So, if you move with the camera around the object 
they should remain in the same place 
(e.g. placed around the object) but if 
you are using a turntable they should turn 
along with the object (e.g. placed underneath the object).
 

### Lighting
Good lighting is required and occlusions 
should be kept to minimum. The ideal conditions 
for an outdoor acquisition require an 
overcast/cloudy day. 

If there is sun that creates shadows, 
you can use a sheet to shade the object of interest. 

For
indoor acquisition, you can use static artificial 
light. In this case, lights should have the same 
intensity. It is better to use diffused light 
that is projected on every surface of the object equally. Two light sources can be placed on the sides 
of the object at an angle of 45 degrees and one
can come from the top. Shadows should be avoided 
as much as possible (thus you might want to add 
more light sources, for example one at the back).

### Background
This should be kept simple and plain. 
There should be high contrast between the 
object and the background (e.g. dark object 
requires bright background).


## Two types of setup

### Object on turntable and camera on tripod
The object is placed on a turntable and the 
camera on a tripod. 

If artificial light is used, 
this should be diffused and should not create shadows. 

The camera should be placed at a height that 
allows to see all important features of the 
artefact (e.g. at an angle of 45 degrees above the object). 

The advantage of this method is that you can have 
lower ISO and shutter speeds and thus sharper images (especially in indoor environments).

### Object at the centre and camera moves around

The object is placed at the centre. 
You move around it and take pictures with the camera. 
Place the item at a good height so that it is 
possible to take images from a higher and a lower level. 

Start by taking an image every 10-15 degrees 
horizontally with 50-60% overlapping. 

As soon as you finish with one series of images 
around the object, raise (or lower) the camera 
10-15 degrees vertically and take another round 
of photos. 
In case some areas are not that visible, 
remember to take different pictures of that 
part from different angles. The advantage of this 
method is that it will allow you to acquire larger 
objects without setting up lights.
